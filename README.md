# YTPlaylistToMP3

Basic console program that converts YouTube videos/playlists to mp3/mp4 files (at a maximum of 720p quality) using the URL. \_**\_
The program mostly uses built-in functions of python's pytube library in a more compact and interactive way.**

_This project was made for me to practice using GitHub._

# YTPlaylistToMP3
Basic console program that converts YouTube playlists to mp3/mp4 files (at a low quality) using the playlists YouTube URL.
The program mostly uses built-in functions of python's pytube library in a more compact and interactive way. 

*This project was made for me to practice using GitHub.*
